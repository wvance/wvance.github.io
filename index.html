        <h3>Welcome to my mkyaljsk vasjkn homepage!</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For our second homework assignment we were asked to create a webpage that ranks the highest for the query "mkyaljsk vasjkn". As of Feburary 4th there was no hits for this query on either Google or Bing. Based on discussions of search engine ranking algorithms in class I know that several factors may impact a page's rank. The goal of this assignment is to use my knowledge to promote my own page to the top of the list. </p>

            <p>Mkyaljsk vasjkn is an ancient norse saying that can be roughly translated to "Pass the yak's milk". It was recently rediscovered following a reevaluation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone">rosetta stone</a></p>
            <p>While there is still much debate regarding the translation of mkyaljsk vasjkn, anthropologists believe that this current translation is quite close to being accurate. So at your next dinner party don't be afraid to show off your intellectual skills and ask the person sitting next to you at the dinner table to Mkyaljsk vasjkn!</p>

              <h2> Howdy! </h2>
              <p style="font-size:125%"> My name is Tyler Windham and I am a junior Computer Science Major at <a href="http://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&amp;M University</a>. Growing up, I've always been a technology enthusiast and an avid sports fan.
                I hope to one day work in IT for a highly respected comapany and raise a family of Aggies. I am currently a Computer Systems Assistant for the Texas A&amp;M Chemistry Department, and this job has provided extra gratification that
                I have chosen the correct major.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:125%">
                As mentioned above, I'm an avid sports fan. In particular, you'll find me rooting for the Fightin' Texas Aggies, the <a href="http://www.nba.com/spurs/">San Antonio Spurs</a>, and the <a href="http://atlanta.braves.mlb.com/index.jsp?c_id=atl"> Atlanta Braves</a>. In my time
                as an Aggie, I've been to all but one home football game, nearly every home basketball game, and a handful of Aggie baseball games. My favorite Aggie sport is basketball and I look forward to seeing what the team will achieve this year.
                I'm also a big music fan and enjoy listening to and discovering new music from all types of genres.
              </p>
              <p style="font-size:125%">
                Currently, I'm competing in the SOE competition for CSCE 470 based on the term mkyaljsk vasjkn. This is the perfect word for a game of Balderdash! In order to try and get my page to the top of Google,
                I am attempting to link my site on popular social media sites such as Twitter and Youtube, while also including the word mkyaljsk vasjkn just enough times to make my page relevant to Google. I also uploaded a Youtube video of the future
                Hall of Famer Chipper Jones that is linked to my page, in order to boost popularity. Feel free to check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/tylerwindham47"> Youtube </a> channel and like my video! You can also follow me on

        Now I know what you're thinking. You again? Your posts mean absolutely nothing. And you're probably right. This blog is primarily for testing purposes and you, the casual user, hate being used experimentally.
        But just hear me out. <br>
        <br>
        mkyaljsk vasjkn<br>
        <br>
        That's right. I'll say it again. <br>

        You might be asking yourself, what the heck even is this. If you google it, you might come across this page <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~aschlaudt">people.tamu.edu/~aschlaudt</a>. She might have some interesting things to say about it. I on the other hand just want to see whether or not you've clicked on that there link. <br>
        <br>
        I also created a page, still working on it, and you can find it at <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~andrew.chepey">people.tamu.edu/~andrew.chepey</a>. It's pretty cool.<br>
        <br>
        In all honesty, folks, this is part of an assignment from school. (Shout out to Cav, one of the funnest professors I've had at A&amp;M) I'm digging up some of my old blog posts and seeing whether or not Google will put me in their rankings. So do me a favor if you're reading this. <br>
        <ol>
          <li>Google mkyaljsk vasjkn</li>
          <li>Click the link containing this blog</li>
          <li>Tell your friends</li>
          <li>Tell your grandma</li>
        </ol>
        Also much of my other posts are pretty bad, so I would appreciate no judgment. Helpful hints are also welcome. Let's see how far up the google ranking my mkyaljsk vasjkn blog post can get.<br>
